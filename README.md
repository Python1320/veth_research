=============

A way to use linux's veth interface to grab and maintain and use multiple IPs from ISP using only one real NIC.

Uses Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client: https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/

It's old code and probably (most likely) won't work as is.

TODO: Replace dhclient with get-dhcplient.sh
